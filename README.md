# TrainingDML-AI Extension Specification

- **Title:** TrainingDML-AI
- **Identifier:** <https://stac-extensions.github.io/trainingdml-ai/v1.0.0/schema.json>
- **Field Name Prefix:** tdml
- **Scope:** Item, Collection
- **Extension [Maturity Classification](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/tree/master/extensions/README.md#extension-maturity):** Proposal
- **Owner**: @TrainingDML

This document explains the fields of The Training Data Markup Language for Artificial Intelligence (TrainingDML-AI)  Extension to the [SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec) (STAC) specification. Training data plays a fundamental role in Earth Observation (EO) Artificial Intelligence Machine Learning (AI/ML), especially Deep Learning (DL). The TrainingDML-AI Extension provides detailed metadata for formalizing the information model of geospatial machine learning training data. This includes but is not limited to the following aspects: 

路    How the training data is prepared, such as provenance or quality;

路    How to specify different metadata used for different ML tasks such as scene/object/pixel levels; 

路    How to differentiate the high-level training data information model and extended information models specific to various ML applications; 

路    How to introduce external classification schemes and flexible means for representing ground truth labeling.

#### tdml:provenance

provenance includes the labeler and the labeling procedure, which can be mapped to the agent and activity respectively in [W3C PROV](https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-overview/) model. The labeler identifies the agent that creates the training dataset or individual samples, and the labeling procedure represents the process for data generation.

## Relation types

It is highly recommended to use the `version-history` as a rel type in the  [Link Object](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/tree/master/item-spec/item-spec.md#link-object) to record the changed training samples between two versions at the collection level as a changeset. The changeset is used to track updates made to a specific version of a sample dataset, identified by its "datasetId" and "version".

There are three types of updates for sample data units: "add" for adding new sample data units, "modify" for modifying existing sample data units, and "delete" for removing sample data units. "Modify" includes changes to metadata of sample data, changes to original data used in sample data, and additions, modifications, and deletions of all labeled objects in the sample data.

## Best Practices

### Core and other extensions fields

It is higly recommended to use the following fields to describe the training dataset:

All contributions are subject to the
[STAC Specification Code of Conduct](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
For contributions, please follow the

for running tests are copied here for convenience.

### Running tests

The same checks that run as checks on PR's are part of the repository and can be run locally to verify that changes are valid. 
To run tests locally, you'll need `npm`, which is a standard part of any [node.js installation](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

First you'll need to install everything with npm once. Just navigate to the root of this repository and on 
your command line run:
```bash
npm install
```

Then to check markdown formatting and test the examples against the JSON schema, you can run:
```bash
npm test
```

This will spit out the same texts that you see online, and you can then go and fix your markdown or examples.

If the tests reveal formatting problems with the examples, you can fix them with:
```bash
npm run format-examples
```
